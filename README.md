# SemanticSounds

This study analyzes the relationship between audio features and
lyrical content using extensive Spotify datasets from Kaggle. By integrating
machine learning we aim to make a user tailored recommender
system. Additionally, we explore semantic meanings in song lyrics
and develop an improved recommender system. This research aims to
prototype a recommender system that is more personalized than those
in music apps.
